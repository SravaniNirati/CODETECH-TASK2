**Overview of the project**

**Project: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION on Spotify_tracks Dataset**

**Objectives**:
1. Build a linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable.
2. Evaluate the model's performance using suitable metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
3. Visualize the regression line and compare actual vs. predicted values to interpret model accuracy.
4. Identify key features influencing the target variable and analyze their relationships.

**Key Activities**:
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Select the target variable and relevant features.
     
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Summarize data statistics.
   - Visualize data distribution and relationships using scatter plots and heatmaps.
   - Identify patterns and correlations between variables.
     
3. **Model Development**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
   - Train a linear regression model on the training set.
   - Optimize and tune the model parameters (if required).
     
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Measure model performance using metrics like MSE and R².
   - Analyze residuals to assess prediction errors.
     
5. **Visualization**:
   - Plot the regression line over the data points.
   - Create actual vs. predicted value plots for better interpretation.
     
6. **Insights & Reporting**:
   - Summarize findings from the model and visualizations.
   - Provide actionable insights based on the analysis.

7. **Technologies Used**:
   - **Python Libraries**:
   - **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data handling and computations.
   - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizations.
   - **Scikit-learn**: For regression model training and evaluation.

8. **Potential Insights**:
   - Understand the relationship between audio features and the target variable.
   - Derive actionable insights for music trend analysis or predictions.
   - Highlight areas where the model performs well and areas for improvement.
